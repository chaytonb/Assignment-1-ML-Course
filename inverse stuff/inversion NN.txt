Idea:
- Produce a number of runs of SNAP from many different NPPs in/around Europe
- Select a number of locations where there will be 'measurement stations' which take point measurements of the dispersion field
- Genreate a dataset (sort of like the ETEX) observations 
- Inputs to the NN will then be the measurements and some number of meteorological variables
- The true values be a map where the values are the distance to the true source location
- NN should output a map with likelihood of source locations for a given set of observations and meteorology
- Extension of this would be to add noise of course, as in the real world there will be noise in the measurements

Input variables:
- The wind speed
