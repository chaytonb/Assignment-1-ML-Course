Introduction:
- What are ATMs
- What is SNAP
- Lagrangian dispersion equations and how they are implemented in SNAP
- Stochastic differential equations
- Challenges of scaling up number of particles (is embarrasingly parallel but limit on computational resources)

Model Training:
- Train model for fixed release location
- Simulate large number of runs using numerical solvers for training
- Test different NN architectures
- Test training with varying wind field (maybe)

Evaluation Accuracy:
- Need to do some statistics on the particles
- Compare spread/distribution of particles from NN prediction and numerical methods
- Should make comparison for multiple plumes

Evaluation Speed:
- Look at run time for individual particle runs
- Look at how time scales when moving up to many particles
- Plot and determine benefit for different particle numbers

Conclusions:
- Discuss how useful/promising this approach is in context of Lagrangian ATMs


Random Ideas:
- Test GPU acceleration for NN training at home
